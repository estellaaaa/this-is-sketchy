# This Is Sketchy!

**This Is Sketchy!** is a 2D RPG set entirely inside the pages of a torn, chaotic notebook. You play as a sketched main character, literally drawn into existence --> who must battle corrupted doodles and messy creations that have come to life.

## Concept & Setting

Everything takes place in a hand-drawn notebook world:  
scribbles, torn edges, sticky notes, ink stains, pencil-shaded environments, and animated sketch lines.  
The art style is intentionally rough and personal, with every design drawn by hand.

## Story

A mysterious **Wizard of Ink** pulls you into the notebook and reveals that the pages are being overrun by **evil doodles**—failed drawings that have been corrupted.  
Your goal is to restore order page by page while discovering why the doodles turned hostile in the first place.

## Gameplay

- **2D real-time RPG combat** against animated doodles  
- **Sketch-style abilities** (eraser, ink slash, pencil barrier --> in work)  
- **Companion wizard** providing spells, buffs, and world interactions  
- **Notebook world exploration** with secrets hidden in margins, sticky notes, and fold-outs --> in work
- **Character progression** through “erasable upgrades” and ink-based collectibles

## Development Details

- Built in **Unity** using **C#**  
- Custom, hand-drawn art style created personally  
- Lightweight and stylized animation relying on frame-by-frame sketch drawings
